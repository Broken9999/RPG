You should integrate the skill pool into your existing classes and gameplay logic. Here's how to do it:

### Step 1: Define the Skill Pools

Place the skill pools at the beginning of your file, just after any import statements. This makes the skills accessible to both players and monsters.

```python
import random
import json

# Skill Pools
skill_pool = {
    "Warrior": [
        PlayerSkill("Power Strike", "A powerful strike that deals extra damage", 30, 15),
        PlayerSkill("Shield Bash", "Stuns the enemy with a shield bash", 10, 10),
        PlayerSkill("Berserk", "Increases damage but reduces defense for a short time", 40, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Whirlwind", "Attacks all nearby enemies with a spinning strike", 25, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Earth Shatter", "Smashes the ground, causing an earthquake that damages all enemies", 35, 25),
        PlayerSkill("Rage", "Temporarily increases attack speed", 20, 15),
        PlayerSkill("Cleave", "A wide swing that hits multiple enemies", 25, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Iron Defense", "Increases defense temporarily", 0, 10)
    ],
    "Archer": [
        PlayerSkill("Double Shot", "Shoots two arrows at once", 20, 10),
        PlayerSkill("Explosive Arrow", "Fires an arrow that explodes on impact", 35, 15),
        PlayerSkill("Poison Arrow", "Shoots an arrow that poisons the enemy", 25, 10),
        PlayerSkill("Snipe", "A precise shot that deals massive damage", 40, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Rain of Arrows", "Fires multiple arrows into the air to hit several enemies", 30, 25),
        PlayerSkill("Camouflage", "Temporarily hide from enemies", 0, 10),
        PlayerSkill("Quick Shot", "A fast shot with increased speed", 15, 8),
        PlayerSkill("Eagle Eye", "Increases accuracy for a short time", 0, 10)
    ],
    "Mage": [
        PlayerSkill("Fireball", "Launches a ball of fire at the enemy", 25, 15),
        PlayerSkill("Ice Shard", "Fires a sharp shard of ice that slows the enemy", 20, 10),
        PlayerSkill("Lightning Bolt", "Strikes the enemy with a bolt of lightning", 30, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Arcane Blast", "Blasts the enemy with arcane energy", 35, 25),
        PlayerSkill("Healing Wave", "Restores health to you or an ally", 0, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Mana Shield", "Absorbs damage using mana", 0, 15),
        PlayerSkill("Teleport", "Move instantly to another location", 0, 20),
        PlayerSkill("Meteor Shower", "Calls down meteors to strike all enemies", 40, 30)
    ]
}

monster_skill_pool = [
    Skill("Dark Slash", "A shadowy strike that deals extra darkness damage", 25),
    Skill("Venom Spit", "Spits venom at the player, causing poison damage over time", 20),
    Skill("Stun Roar", "Lets out a roar that stuns the player", 0),
    Skill("Flame Breath", "Breathes fire to deal massive fire damage", 30),
    Skill("Ice Spike", "Launches a spike of ice to slow the player", 20),
    Skill("Thunder Clap", "Summons a thunderstorm to strike the player", 35),
    Skill("Shadow Bind", "Binds the player in shadows, reducing movement speed", 0),
    Skill("Earthquake", "Causes the ground to shake, damaging and disorienting the player", 30),
    Skill("Drain Life", "Saps the life from the player, healing the monster", 25),
    Skill("Fury Swipe", "A series of fast swipes that deal rapid damage", 15),
    Skill("Dark Aura", "Envelops the monster in darkness, reducing damage taken", 0),
    Skill("Poison Cloud", "Creates a cloud of poison that damages the player over time", 20),
    Skill("Inferno", "Summons a ring of fire around the player", 35),
    Skill("Frozen Touch", "Freezes the player in place, dealing cold damage", 20),
    Skill("Lightning Surge", "Unleashes a surge of lightning at the player", 30)
]
```

### Step 2: Assign Skills to Players and Monsters

#### **For Players**:
In your `Player` class, modify the constructor to include skills. When a player levels up or reaches a specific milestone, you can add new skills to their skill set.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, username, player_class, stats, inventory, coins, current_area):
        self.username = username
        self.player_class = player_class
        self.stats = stats
        self.inventory = inventory
        self.coins = coins
        self.current_area = current_area
        self.skills = self.get_initial_skills()

    def get_initial_skills(self):
        return random.sample(skill_pool[self.player_class], 1)  # Start with one skill

    def level_up(self):
        self.stats['level'] += 1
        self.stats['health'] += 20
        self.stats['mana'] += 10
        self.stats['damage'] += 5
        print(f"\nCongratulations! You've reached level {self.stats['level']}!")
        if self.stats['level'] % 5 == 0:
            new_skill = random.choice(skill_pool[self.player_class])
            if new_skill not in self.skills:
                self.skills.append(new_skill)
                print(f"You have learned a new skill: {new_skill.name}!")
```

#### **For Monsters**:
In your `Monster` class, add logic to assign skills based on the monster's level.

```python
class Monster:
    def __init__(self, name, health, damage, element, level):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.damage = damage
        self.element = element
        self.level = level
        self.skills = self.get_skills()

    def get_skills(self):
        skill_count = self.level // 10  # One skill for every 10 levels
        return random.sample(monster_skill_pool, min(skill_count, len(monster_skill_pool)))


### Step 3: Use Skills in Combat

In your `Game` class, implement the logic to use skills during combat.

```python
def fight_monster(self, mob):
    player_health = self.player.stats['health']
    xp_gain = 10 * self.player.stats['level']

    while mob.health > 0 and player_health > 0:
        print(f"\nFighting {mob.name}:")
        action = input("1. Attack\n2. Use a Potion\n3. View Stats\n4. Use Skill\nChoose an action: ").strip().lower()

        if action in ['1', 'attack']:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(self.player.stats['damage'] + random.randint(-5, 5), mob.element)
            print(f"You dealt {damage} damage to the {mob.name}.")
            if mob.take_damage(damage):
                print(f"The {mob.name} has been defeated!")
                self.player.coins += 50
                weapon_drop = Item("Mystic Sword", "weapon", damage_bonus=10)
                self.player.inventory["weapons"].append(weapon_drop)
                print(f"You found a {weapon_drop.name}!")
                self.player.stats['xp'] += xp_gain
                print(f"You gained {xp_gain} XP.")
                if self.player.stats['xp'] >= 100 * self.player.stats['level']:
                    self.player.level_up()
                break
        elif action in ['2', 'use a potion', 'potion']:
            self.use_potions()
        elif action in ['3', 'view stats', 'stats']:
            self.player.view_stats()
        elif action in ['4', 'use skill', 'skill']:
            self.use_player_skill(mob)
        else:
            print("Invalid action. Please choose a valid option.")
            continue

        if mob.health > 0:
            print(f"Monster Health after attack: {mob.health}")
            player_health -= mob.damage
            print(f"The {mob.name} dealt {mob.damage} damage to you.")
            print(f"Player Health after attack: {player_health}")
            if player_health <= 0:
                print("You have been defeated!")
                break

    self.player.stats['health'] = player_health
```

### Step 4: Save and Run Your Game

Once you've added the skill pools and adjusted your classes, save the file and run the game. Players and monsters will now have access to skills that can be used in combat.
